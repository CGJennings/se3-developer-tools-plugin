# Developer tools plug-in for [Strange Eons](https://github.com/CGJennings/strange-eons)

This repository contains the source code for the developer tools plug-in. The plug-in includes tools to explore and edit settings, monitor memory use, view and clear caches, highlight regions on preview images, and more.

**Note:** If you simply want to *use* this plug-in, install it from the [plug-in catalogue](http://se3docs.cgjennings.ca/um-plugins-catalogue.html). A quick way to do that is to copy this text: `eonscat:6574` and then switch to the Strange Eons window.

## Building the plug-in

The plug-in expects the Strange Eons repository to be in a sibling directory, like this:

```
your-projects-directory/
  strange-eons/
  se3-developert-tools-plugin/
```

After a successful build, the plug-in will be written to the `dist` folder.
